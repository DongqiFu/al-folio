I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). It is my great honor to be a student of Prof. [Jingrui He](https://www.hejingrui.org/) at [iSAIL Lab](https://isail-laboratory.github.io/).

My research interests focus on investigating **Natural Dynamics** and **Artificial Dynamics** in Graph Mining, Graph Representations, and Graph Neural Networks.
